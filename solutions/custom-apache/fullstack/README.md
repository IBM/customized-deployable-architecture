# Application Extension as a fullstack implementation

This example shows a fullstack implemention.  The fullstack is a base layer deployed by the custom deployable architecture in this repo followed by the
deployment of a workload, an Apach server.  This all done in one overall operation.  The consumer would not need to be concerned with first deploying the 
prerequisite base layer.  The fullstack deploys everything that is needed.

This fullstack example deploys both of the examples contained here to show how they may be reused in larger solutions.
