# Application Extension for Custom Secure Infrastructure on VPC

This example shows how an extension could be added on to an existing Custom Secure Infrastructure landscape by deploying an additional 
Virtual Server into the Workload VPC.  The virtual server is initialized and configured as an *Apache web server*.

The deployment mechanism for Apache onto the VSI is Ansible.
